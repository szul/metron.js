# metron
Lightweight JavaScript convenience library

This is not a replacement for jQuery or any other high end framework.
It is meant as a lightweight library for instances where a smaller subset of helper functions are needed.
It was originally used in Windows XP and Windows 7 gadgets, and was later used in Titanium mobile development.
