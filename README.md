# metron
Lightweight JavaScript convenience library

This is not a replacement for jQuery or any other high end framework.
It is meant as a lightweight library for instances where a smaller subset of helper functions are needed.
It was originally used in Windows XP and Windows 7 gadgets, and was later used in Titanium mobile development.

This repo contains the development branch. For the stable files, use the CDN:

## Maintenance notes
This library is deprecated. It will be updated with bug fixes, but no further development will occur. Instead, `metron` is being rebuilt from the ground up in TypeScript.
